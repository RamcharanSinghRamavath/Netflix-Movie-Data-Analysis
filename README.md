- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive analysis)
 # Installation 
 1. clone the Repository
    git clone <https://github.com/RamcharanSinghRamavath/Netflix-Movie-Data-Analysis/>

 2.Install required libraries:
 
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter

 3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    jupyter notebook
# Code Workflow

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('netflix_movies.csv')

# Data Cleaning
# Splitting and exploding the 'Genre' column
df['Genre'] = df['Genre'].fillna('').str.split(',')
df = df.explode('Genre')
df['Genre'] = df['Genre'].str.strip()
df = df[df['Genre'] != '']

# Most Frequent Genre
most_frequent_genre = df['Genre'].value_counts().idxmax()
print(f"Most Frequent Genre: {most_frequent_genre}")

# Movie with Highest Popularity
most_popular_movie = df.loc[df['popularity'].idxmax()]
print(f"Most Popular Movie: {most_popular_movie['title']}")

# Movie with Lowest Popularity
least_popular_movie = df.loc[df['popularity'].idxmin()]
print(f"Least Popular Movie: {least_popular_movie['title']}")

# Year with Most Movie Releases
yearly_release = df['release_year'].value_counts().idxmax()
print(f"Year with Most Releases: {yearly_release}")

# Visualization of Genre Distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.countplot(y='Genre', data=df, order=df['Genre'].value_counts().index)
plt.title('Distribution of Movie Genres')
plt.xlabel('Count')
plt.ylabel('Genre')
plt.show()

## Future Improvements:
- Include TV shows in the analysis.

- Predict future genre trends using machine learning.

- Analyze user ratings and reviews for deeper insights.
